# EEE4022S - Localisation using NeRFs

This is repository to store the files used for my project "Localisation using NeRFs." Here you will find:

1. `data_collect.py` - This is the file which we intended to modify for the teach stage of localisation. There are 3 new functions there that are related to preparing the localisation model with NeRF data
2. `poseToJson.py` - This is the file used to take in a pose matrix and update another Json file. This is the json file used by Nerfstudio to generate novel poses
